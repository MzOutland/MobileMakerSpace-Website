# MobileMakerSpace-Website
This website is a work in progress. It is a "How to" for educators as a means of assiting them in creating a 3D Printer Mobile Makerspace. This website serves as a portfolio of sorts that demonstrates what I have learned during my participation in Code Kentucky. It is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site.
